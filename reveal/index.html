						The initial development of the technology was to send telegrams over the Atlantic. While Tesla was working on means to send wireless transmissions over the Atlantic, he discovered a gentleman was working on the same technology using some of his patents. Instead of taking legal action against him Tesla decided he had to prove his genius and create something even greater than wireless transmissions of telegrams to the United Kingdom he wanted to send electricity all over the world. This would eventually prove to be the demise of Tesla’s laboratory as his funding was pulled due to breach of contract, and his tower was destroyed.

						Even though Tesla may have failed in his attempts to create wireless transmissions and electricity. The modern communications that rely on wireless radio frequency modulation have Tesla to thank. Our modern use of wireless communication is based on a lower power variation on these technologies once being developed by Tesla. Even though Tesla was not the only person constructing methods of wireless communication, he was one of the very few crazy enough to attempt wireless electricity transmission. The modern use of this technology has remained stagnant on being used for communication. A world wide network of wireless electricity might be the right next step.

						The use of wireless electricity may have moral complications. Mainly use of conflict minerals such as cobalt in the unavoidable capacitors. When using wireless electricity, we would require some sort of charge holding material to allow for the harnessing of wireless electricity before it could be used. These problems with cobalt and capacitors would come further into the foreground, as wireless electricity would mean the use of capacitors would increase resulting in increased mining of these minerals. However, with some research an alternative may be able to help maintain morality in the development of these technologies.

						A possible saviour in the case of conflict minerals in supercapacitors could be a synthesised cobalt tungstate. The synthesis of these chemicals allows for less moral implications involving the use of supercapacitors. This synthesised form could prove to be very useful, however there are other chemicals available. Elon Musk’s Tesla Corporation uses nickel in the production of its supercapacitors, which may prove to be a more financially feasible alternative to the synthesised cobalt. Ensuring that this new technology is morally sound is a necessary humanist approach, viewing the monetary value second to innovation.

						While keeping in mind the reduced waste that would be a result of reduced waste from batteries. It is important to consider what the environmental implications are of modulating the magnetic resonance of the earth. Even though humans would be able to use the waves to power their electronics and lives. We are unaware of how the possible effects it may have on animals that rely on the magnetic field of the earth for navigation. There could be a plethora of unknown side effects on wildlife like birds and butterflies with them relying on the natural magnetic frequencies of the earth. Keeping to our moral principals, could we develop and implement these technologies that could push humanity further while knowingly or even unknowingly affect all the other species we share this planet with.

## Bio
I am in my third year of study at Brock University, majoring in Interactive Arts and Sciences and Studio Art. I am concentrating on instructional design, with a specific focus on user interface design. My co-major with studio art helps me develop my visual communication skills, so I can develop interfaces that are less wordy and more intuitive. The struggle between intuition and the regional and educational biases that support it, would be an area of interest for me in a post-graduate program. My presentation on Wireless Electricity demonstrates the possibility of a new form of interaction with technology. Developing new usage patterns and making charging more intuitive, by not having to think about the need to charge electronics. I will further develop this research into intuitive user interface design, while focusing on consumer products and the arts. This would involve developing new methods of interacting with visual arts in the exhibition space, and theatrical space. The consumer product focus would be heavily based on background tasks that automate physical processes, for example the light turning on automatically in a refrigerator, or having a phone screen turn on when it is removed from your pocket.

## Featured Project: Wireless Electricity

Wireless electricity has the possibility to change the way we interact with modern technology. The days of electrical fires and the enormous amount of land taken up by long distance electricity could be behind us! The new push towards electric cars would be expediently pushed forward by the promise of unlimited range. Pollution could be virtually eliminated with the use of electrically powered boats and planes. The possibilities and effects of wireless electricity are explored through the inception of the idea, and its developments. Following up with an analysis of the technology that we have developed following the extinguishing of the idea, and how the technology would affect our use and evolution of modern electronics. The exploration of these ideas is important to the broadening of what we consider possible. Finding new means of interaction and forms of technological evolution are an important focus for the future of digital humanities. As the digital humanities are the key stone of introducing and integrating technology in scholarly settings. When developing new techniques of information analysis and interpretation, finding effective ways of interacting with the new forms of display can be very important. Just as important as the techniques themselves is how the technique is used or viewed. When developing digital charts and analytical tools an interface that allows the viewer to modify and express different views, enables the digitality to be utilized completely.

## Collaborative Project
In collaboration with some collegues, I investigated the uses and possibilities of Google Arts and Culture, as well as Serendip-o-matic. The multiplicity of Google Arts and Culture lends itself to a leisurely scholastic environment. With the ability to find works that are exclusively in museums there is a wealth of possibilities for research and analyses. Serendip-o-matic is an interesting tool, letting scholars find images based on inputted text for copy-right free or creative commons friendly images. This tool becomes useful in the writing of blog posts and articles, however having some significant drawbacks it partially succeeds in what it sets out to do. We used a common search term to analyse the possibilities of uses of each tool, using the White Breasted Nuthatch as the subject we found the Google A&C tool found historic paintings while the Serendip-o-matic found visualised sound recording, linking to audio. We concluded the tools work best in the beginning of research and the finalization of academic works.

When approaching collaborative scholarship, I find dividing into sub-groups and finding specializations is the most effective way of creating a functioning group environment. To maintain an effective group having consistent meetings and workflow are imperative. Keeping that in mind using tools that everyone is familiar with is also very important. When it came to completing the project in question, we discussed as a group that using collaborative tools made by Google was the best way to share information and complete the project. In keeping with the guidelines we had to use Github which majority of us were uncomfortable with, to comply we made attempts to share information through it (commit found [here](https://github.com/IascAtBrock/IASC-2P02-TeamPresentations/commit/e3b40eaab5334980dec50d41bb3df5b4c1f874b0)). When working in a collaborative environment, the intellectual discourse expedites development of ideas, challenging me to develop further or consider alternative I may have initially been opposed to. Through years of digital collaboration, I have found the Google Suite is the most universally available and useable tool. Using that in combination with an online messaging platform allows for accountability to be setup with a common space for instant discussions. When working in a group for a prolonged period I find Blackberry Messenger has everything that is needed to manage a project. Using tools such as digital checklist and scheduling that are synced together allows for an easy measure of progress. Working collaboratively on research allows for a variety of views on opiniated topics. As I generally view everything through the interaction between users or a user and the interface, a colleague may view everything through representation and communication of information.
